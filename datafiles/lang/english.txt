tutorial1 = "Press [J] to jump! Hold [D] and a direction to crawl!"
tutorial2 = "You can break marble and metal blocks underneath you with a bodyslam! Press [g] while in the air!"
tutorial3 = "Start the bodyslam from higher to destroy metal blocks!"
tutorial4 = "Some blocks may be hidden, keep an eye out for them! Press [G] to destroy them!"
tutorial5 = "Press [G] to do the Grab Dash! It can destroy marble blocks!"
tutorial6 = "Hold [M] to start a Mach Run! If you hold [M] then jump on a wall, you will start wall running!"
tutorial7 = "Press [J] while wall running to jump off the wall! Keep [M] held to stick on the other walls! A tip: You can also use the Grab Dash to start a wall run while in the air, just keep [M] held!"
tutorial8 = "Press [G] then hold [M] for a quick start with the Mach Run! Try it out!"
tutorial9 = "You can also jump after pressing [G] in order to do a long jump!"
tutorial10 = "You can also simply run up a slope next to a wall to automatically start wall running!"
tutorial11 = "While doing a Mach Run, hold [D] to destroy blocks in a small gap!"
tutorial12 = "Release [D] and keep holding [M] to continue the Mach Run!"
tutorial13 = "Hold [D] during a Mach Run while in the air to do a dive!"
tutorial14 = "In order to destroy metal blocks, you need to gain speed by doing the Mach Run. You can hold [F] to go even faster too!"
tutorial15 = "Running down a slope will make you go faster!"
tutorial16 = "To turn while retaining Mach Run, press the opposite direction."
tutorial17 = "Try turning before falling down a hole, you will retain your speed once on the ground"
tutorial18 = "While at high speed, hold [s] then release it to perform the Super Jump! You can also adjust your position with [L][R] while you are holding [s]!"
tutorial19 = "After starting a Super Jump, you can also dash forward in the air by pressing [G]! It breaks metal blocks too, give it a try!"
tutorial20 = "Another trick: Press [G] then [D] immediately to go through gaps faster!"
tutorial21 = "You can grab things with the Grab Dash and throw them by pressing [G] again!"
tutorial22 = "If you hold [U] before throwing, you will send the things up!"
tutorial23 = "Collect these in order to get a better rank! Some can only be acquired during the escape..."
tutorial24 = "You need to save most of the dudes in the cages in order to advance to the next floor! They will give you money to pay Mr.Stick! If you miss too many of them, you will need to replay some levels!"
tutorial25 = "Destroy John the pillar in order to open the exit gate. This will reverse the solid pillar blocks!"

# GUSTAVO TUTORIAL
# -----------------
forest1 = "Hold [M] to move faster and destroy metal blocks!"
forest2 = "Press [U][G] to kick the rat! You can also press [S] while grounded to blast him away!"
forest3 = "Press [J] in the air to do a double jump! Pressing [S] instead will send the rat attacking straight down, for less height. You can cancel out of these with other moves, too!"
forest4 = "Press [D] middair to quickly go down! A tip: unlike Peppino, doing a ground pound will not destroy metal blocks."
forest5 = "The double jump, [J], and the rat dismount jump, [S] in mid-air, CAN be used to destroy metal blocks!"
forest6 = "While doing the double jump, hold [J] while holding in the direction of a wall to climb it!"
forest7 = "A tip: while riding the rat, pressing [G] will activate a short dash move that stalls you momentarily mid-air. You can cancel this into other moves, like an additional jump or extra attack."

# HUB TIPS

hubtips1 = "Did you know you could do a flying uppercut by pressing [U] then [G]? This can work as a pseudo double jump and can also dispatch enemies in the air!"
hubtips2 = "After dispatching a few enemies, you might have noticed the electricity effect around you. While the effect is active, press [U] then [T] to dispatch every enemy on the screen!"
hubtips3 = "Did you know that you can block and parry any projectile or damage by pressing [T] before getting hurt?"
hubtips4 = "Be wary of your final judgement. Your performance is always accounted for. A tip: judgement may or may not be final."
hubtips5 = "Once you have beaten a level, you can revisit it to find a Lap 2 portal near the entrance. These will give you a point bonus, but also force you to loop around the escape portion one more time..."
hubtips6 = "Did you know that you can do a piledriver by holding an enemy and pressing [D] while in the air ? You can also perform a piledriver that will boost you upward if you hold [U] before grabbing an enemy."
hubtips7 = "An obscure technique: While doing a dive in the air and pressing [J], you will directly go downward with a body slam. Only useful if you want to save time!"
hubtips8 = "Did you know that you can make enemies react to you faster by pressing [T] near them?"
hubtips9 = "The elusive P rank... You can get it by doing everything there is to do in a level. The problem is that you need to keep a combo for the entirety of the level! It's a tough challenge, so don't feel bad if you don't want to do it!"

Well, we're down from your pizzeria, and we're down from this tower. There are customers, and they want to see one of these things. So I got a friend, he went down one of the floors and this guy came up next to me, and the idea was, why is it that when you're in the upper part of the tower there is this Pizzaface character, then there's a man from your previous life leading the way? There's a pizza in your tower with all this information."
garbage7 = "Pizza Tower Instant Pizza Gaming Promotion! Type /pizza to order a free pizza courtesy of Peppino's Pizza!"
